### Project Structure:

The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, ensuring better maintainability and reusability of code. Test cases are organized under:

```src
│

├── resources
│ └── features
│ ├── Shapermint.feature (for Selenium WebDriver)
│ └── ShapermintApi.feature (for RestAssured)
```


### Running Tests:
